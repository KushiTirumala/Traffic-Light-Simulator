Traffic Light Simulator – Java Multithreading

A multi-threaded traffic light simulation system for a road junction built using Java, demonstrating multithreading, circular queue logic, exception handling, and OOP principles.

 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world traffic signal system where each signal operates on a separate thread with time-based control. A circular queue manages traffic light sequencing, ensuring smooth rotation and fairness at the junction.

 Key Features

Multi-threaded traffic light simulation

Circular Queue logic for signal rotation

Time-based signal control using Thread.sleep()

Exception handling for invalid user input

Modular, object-oriented design

Console-based real-time simulation
